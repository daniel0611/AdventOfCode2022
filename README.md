This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2022 challenges.
For more information visit: https://adventofcode.com/2022/about

The solutions to the days can be run using `cargo run -p dayxy` (e.g. `-p day01`) and a new day can be generated by running `cargo run -p add-day`.
